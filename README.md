This project aims to classify toxic comments using machine learning models. It demonstrates the process of cleaning text data, converting it into numerical features using TF-IDF, and applying different machine learning algorithms to classify comments as toxic or non-toxic.

 Project Structure
- main.py: Python script containing the data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

 Features
1. Text Cleaning: The text data is cleaned by removing HTML tags, URLs, special characters, and converting the text to lowercase.
2. Text Preprocessing: Lemmatization is applied to reduce words to their base form.
3. TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts the cleaned text data into numerical features for machine learning models.
4. Modeling: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Grid Search Cross-Validation are used to build and optimize models.
5. Evaluation: The models are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and other classification metrics.

 Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   `bash
   git clone https://github.com/Valera9Er9Coder/toxic_comment_classifier.git
